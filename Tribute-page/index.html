                    <p><em>
                            "I should say, love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world, which is getting more and
                            more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to
                            put up with the fact that some people say things that we don't like. We can only live
                            together in that way—and if we are to live together and not die together—we must learn a
                            kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of
                            human life on this planet."
