            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
                structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
                appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
                linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>
                An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name
                surrounded by "&lt;" and "&gt;" . The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it
                can be
                written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as
                &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is
                to write
                tags in lowercase.

            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain
                way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
                italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
                content:</p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                alt="Description of how opening and closing tags work.">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
                    wrapped in opening and
                    closing <strong>angle brackets.</strong> This states where the element begins or starts to take
                    effect — in this case
                    where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li><strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                    forward slash before
                    the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
                    Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise
                    the element.</li>
            </ol>

            <header id="HTML_text_fundamentals">HTML text fundamentals</header>
            <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way
                its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by
                adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.</p>
            <p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a
                college textbook, a magazine, etc. Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more
                enjoyable.</p>
            <p>In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a
            <p> element, like so:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.&lt;p&gt;</code>
            <p>Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;I am the title of the story.&lt;h1&gt;</code>
            <p>There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of
                content in the document;
                &lt;h1&gt; represents the main heading, &lt;h2&gt; represents subheadings, &lt;h3&gt; represents
                sub-subheadings, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>Implementing structural hierarchy:</p>
            <p>For example, in this story, the
                &lt;h1&gt; element represents the title of the story, the &lt;h2&gt; elements represent the title of
                each chapter, and
                the &lt;h3&gt; elements represent sub-sections of each chapter:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;h1&gt;The Crushing Bore&lt;/h1&gt;
                <p></p>&lt;p&gt;By Chris Mills&lt;/p&gt;
                <p></p>&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: The dark night&lt;/h2&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;p&gt;
                <p>
                  It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the…
                </p>
                &lt;/p&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2: The eternal silence&lt;/h2&gt;
                <p></p>
                &lt;p&gt;Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure…&lt;/p&gt;
                <p></p>
                &lt;h3&gt;The specter speaks&lt;/h3&gt;
                
                <br>
                &lt;p&gt;
                <p>
                    Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
                    upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
                </p>
                &lt;/p&gt;
                <br>
            </code>
            <p>It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You
                just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preferably, you should use a single &lt;h1&gt; per page—this is the top level heading, and all
                    others sit
                    below this in the hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use &lt;h3&gt; elements
                    to
                    represent subheadings, followed by &lt;h2&gt; elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't
                    make
                    sense and will lead to weird results.</li>
                <li>Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you
                    feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become
                    unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over
                    multiple pages if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <header id="Lists">Lists</header>
            <p>Now let's turn our attention to lists. Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list
                of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you
                are following in these tutorials! Lists are everywhere on the web, too, and we've got three different
                types to worry about.</p>
            <p>Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. Let's
                take a shopping list as an example:</p>
            <code>
                milk
                <br>
                eggs
                <br>
                bread
                <br>
                hummus
            </code>
            <p>Every unordered list starts off with a &lt;ul&gt; element—this wraps around all the list items:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    <p>
                    milk
                    <br>
                    eggs
                    <br>
                    bread
                    <br>
                    hummus
                </p>
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            </code>
            <p>The last step is to wrap each list item in a &lt;li&gt; (list item) element:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    <p>
                    &lt;li&gt;milk&lt;/li&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;li&gt;eggs&lt;/li&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;li&gt;bread&lt;/li&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;li&gt;hummus&lt;/li&gt;
                </p>
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            </code>
            <p>Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. Let's take a set of directions as an
                example:</p>
            <code>
                Drive to the end of the road<br>
                Turn right <br>
                Go straight across the first two roundabouts <br>
                Turn left at the third roundabout <br>
                The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road
            </code>
            <p>The markup structure is the same as for unordered lists, except that you have to wrap the list items in
                an &lt;ol&gt; element, rather than &lt;ul&gt;:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;ol&gt;
                <p>
                &lt;li&gt;Drive to the end of the road&lt;/li&gt; <br>
                &lt;li&gt;Turn right&lt;/li&gt; <br>
                &lt;li&gt;Go straight across the first two roundabouts&lt;/li&gt; <br>
                &lt;li&gt;Turn left at the third roundabout&lt;/li&gt; <br>
                &lt;li&gt;The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road&lt;/li&gt;
                </p>
                &lt;/ol&gt;
            </code>

            <header id="Creating_hyperlinks">Creating hyperlinks</header>
            <p>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the Web a web. This article shows the syntax
                required to make a link, and discusses link best practices.</p>
            <p>Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the
                Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to
                other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web
                address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated
                the web browser goes to another web address (URL).</p>
            <p>For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also
                different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.
            </p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks/updated-bbc-website.png"
                alt="an image of the bcc homepage">
            <p>A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an &lt;a&gt; element and using the
                href
                attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.</p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                <p>
                I'm creating a link to <br>
                &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;. <br>
            </p>
            &lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>It's possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document, known as a document fragment, rather than
                just to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you
                want to link to. It normally makes sense to link to a specific heading, so this would look something
                like the following:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;h2 id="Mailing_address"> Mailing address &lt;/h2&gt;
            </code>
            <p>Then to link to that specific id, you'd include it at the end of the URL, preceded by a hash/pound symbol
                (#), for example:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                <p>
                    Want to write us a letter? Use our <br>
                    &lt;a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address"> mailing address &lt;/a&gt;.
                </p>
                &lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                It's possible to create links or buttons that, when clicked, open a new outgoing email message rather
                than linking to a resource or page. This is done using the &lt;a&gt; element and the mailto: URL scheme.
                In its most basic and commonly used form, a mailto: link indicates the email address of the intended
                recipient. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org"> Send email to nowhere &lt;/a&gt;

            <header id="Basic_sections_of_a_document">Basic sections of a document</header>
            <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard
                components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art
                project, or is just badly structured:</p>
            <p>header:</p>
            <p>Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays
                the same from one webpage to another.</p>
            <p>navigation bar:</p>
            <p>Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header,
                this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on
                your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation
                bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact,
                some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the
                two features better if they are separate.</p>
            <p>main content:</p>
            <p>A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the
                video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news
                headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</p>
            <p>sidebar:</p>
            <p>Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the
                main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links
                to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary
                navigation system.</p>
            <p>footer:</p>
            <p>A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact
                info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not
                critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by
                providing links for quick access to popular content.</p>

            <p>Once you've planned out the structure of a simple webpage, the next logical step is to try to work out
                what content you want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged
                and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called Information architecture.
                In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a simple website of a
                few pages, this can be fairly simple, and fun!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bear in mind that you'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages — such as the
                    navigation menu, and the footer content. If your site is for a business, for example, it's a good
                    idea to have your contact information available in the footer on each page. Note down what you want
                    to have common to every page.</li>
                <li>Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure of each page to look like (it might
                    look like our simple website above). Note what each block is going to be.</li>
                <li>Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content you want to have on your website —
                    write a big list down. </li>
                <li>Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, to give you an idea of what parts might live
                    together on different pages. This is very similar to a technique called Card sorting.</li>
                <li>Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for each page on your site, and draw lines to show
                    the typical workflow between pages. The homepage will probably be in the center, and link to most if
                    not all of the others; most of the pages in a small site should be available from the main
                    navigation, although there are exceptions. You might also want to include notes about how things
                    might be presented.</li>
            </ol>
